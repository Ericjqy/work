Assessment: Assignment 1--OO Classifier

Running instructions: 
  In the dirctory containing the files Makefile, README, ooclassifer.py, submission_validator.py, and some unittest 
and alltest files for check my program. You can use cat <input.file.txt> | python3 ooclassifer <mode> to run the 
program, or you can use the unittest and alltest files or simply import the code to run it. Note, the <mode> optional
command line argument can only be "keep-digits", "keep-stops" or keep-symbols". Other input will return an error.

Notes and Assumptions:
  The file ooclassifer.py contains five class, which are C274 (as a super class), ClassifyByTarget() (used to classify
and print out the result), ClassifyByTopN (used to determine how many top frequent words you wish to set as a target),
TrainingInstance (used for data store and preprocess) and TrainingSet (used to store trainingSet data).
  Based on the original code from class, I wrote three new functionality to ooclassifer.py. The first functionality is
preprocess. The method locate at TrainingSet Class, which will read the data from training instance and modify them.
Second functionality is word frequency classification algorithm, locate at ClassifyByTopN. This method will find the
indicated top N most frequent words and let them become new target words list. It requires you to input the object of 
TrainingSet and two optional argument num with default value 5 and Label with default string ''. The third one is 
N-folds for cross validation functionality locate at TrainingSet class. It will implement a cross validation in order 
to increase the accuracy, recall and precision of the classification. It only has one optional input argument, num, 
with default value 3.

Assumption:
  This program assume you input a text with annotated pos-features and pos-label words. The text should have form:
#<label>     <content>. Ex: "#help      i am not feeling well". The other type of file might cause error.
