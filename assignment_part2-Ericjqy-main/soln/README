Assignment 1: Navigation System Part II

Included Files:
  in dictory soln/
  *Makefile
  *README
  in dictory soln/server/
  *Makefile
  *digraph.cpp
  *digraph.h
  *dijkstra.cpp

  *server.cpp
  *widgraph.h

Running instructions:
  In the dictory of soln/, Using command "make" to constact the compilor, the Makefile will constract the 
executable file "server" in the dictory soln/server. Then you should type "./server/server" in the terminal and
open another terminal in dictory of soln/ and type "python3 client/client.py". The windows will shows up and you
should select two points as starting and ending, the shortest path will be demonstrated on the windows and the
coordinates in details will be shown on terminal.  
  At the end, close the plotter window, then all program will exit. You can use the Makefile in the dictory of 
soln/ to remove all executable, objects, and named pipes by typing "make clean". 
  The Makefile on soln/server has two objects. "Server" is used to constrate an executable file and the "clean"
is used to clean the executable and any object files. 

Notes and Assumptions:
  The file server.cpp only modified the main program. It now remove the function of using terminal IO to check the
shortest path. Now it create two FIFO to receive data from plotter and send the shortest path to the plotter.

Assumption:
  The user must follows the process mentioned in the running instructions, else may cause error or incorrect result.
