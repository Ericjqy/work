Assessment: Assignment 2--Huffman Coding

Running instructions: 
    In the dirctory containing the files Makefile, README, bitio.py, compress.py, decompress.py, huffman.py, util.py,
webserver.py and other files used to test my code. You can use "python3 decompress.py <file.name>" to decompress the 
indecated file or use "python3 compress.py <file.name>" to compress the indecated file. 

Notes and Assumptions:
    The file util.py contains five method, which are read_tree(tree_stream), decode_byte(tree, bitreader), decompress(
compressed, uncompressed), write_tree(tree, tree_stream) and compress(tree, uncompressed, compressed).
  The method compress requires three argument, a huffman tree(tree), a file stream that you want to read as input(
uncompress) and a file stream to receive the tree description and coded input data.
  The method write_tree will receive a huffman tree and write it into file stream "tree_stream".
  The method decompress will receive two argument, an input compressed file stream and an output uncompressed file 
stream. The decompress method will read the compressed file stream and based on the tree description to analyze the 
data and write it in uncompressed form to uncompressed file stream.
  The method read_tree is used to load the tree description in the "tree_stream" which is a steam and return the 
huffman tree.
  The method decode_byte is used to base on the huffman tree, to analyze the indicated binary data.
Assumption:
  This program assume you input a proper binary file for decompress or text file for compress. If you didn't indicate
the file you want to operate, the program will stop.
    Acknowledgements:
    1. Refered the code in lecture slide
    2. code of method decode_byte and decompress received help from my friend Kevin Huang
