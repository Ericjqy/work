Included Files:
  *climbing.cpp
  *README
  *Makefile

Running instructions: 
  可以通过在terminal输入“make”的方式来建立compiler，然后通过输入"./we7_solution"来运行。

Notes and Assumptions:
  The file climbing.cpp contains two function, get_num_times function is used to find the how much times need 
for the input burst. It has 7 arguments, the input arguments:heights: record the given ledges' hight in an array.
length: the total number of ledges.	rest: the time need for resting in ledge.	L: the input burst distance. And
other argument:	num: used to record the total distance had climbbed. At the end, it represent the total time spend.
wait: the total rest time. min: the ledge that the people rest and begin his climbing. It has one return value, num
representing the total time spend. climbing function is used to find the shortest possible burst by binary search.
It takes the following input arguments: heights: record the given ledges' hight in an array. length: the total 
number of ledges.	rest: the time need for resting in ledge.	limit: the output burst we want. It has one return
value, low+1. At the end, high will equal to low, but since we let high be the burst that equal to low, so we let 
low+1 to get the	correct value.
  Assumption: 
    When running the program, you need to first input three number separated by space, first value is number of 
  ledges. Second input is the time for one rest and the third argument is the limited time that you want to climb
  the moutain. The following inputs, you need to input the hight of ledges from low to high. And notice that, this
  program will not indicate the situation that limit is too large or too little and will give an wrong result.
